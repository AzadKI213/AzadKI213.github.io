I wanted a quiet corner of the internet that feels unhurriedâ€”a place to document experiments, map useful ideas, and stay accountable to the projects I care about.

In the Frost Journal you'll find:

- Notes on the products I'm building and the workflows that keep them moving.
- Field reports on tools for thinking, from AI assistants to tactile notebooks.
- Occasional reflections on pace, focus, and creative sustainability.

Everything here is intentionally simple. Articles are written in Markdown, versioned with Git, and published automatically through GitHub Pages. That means every piece has a changelog, and I can always roll back to what matters.

Thank you for reading and for sharing this calm space with me.
